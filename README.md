# MLShowcaseAngular

MLShowcaseAngular is a project that shows how [TensorflowJS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) use model converters to run pre-existing TensorFlow models right in the browser.

To use cuurent version of the appliction, see the MLShowcaseAngular [website](https://danielgolikov.com).

The whole project is written in Angular 14

The project demonstrates both the use of existing models (Mobilenet, etc.) and models trained for this project (Disney Characters Classifier, etc).

The backend function is performed by https://github.com/DanielGolikov/ml-showcase-backend

The code used to create models is available on [ML-showcase-models](https://github.com/DanielGolikov/ml-showcase-models)

All project specific models are trained using the [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) library.
