# MLShowcaseAngular
This project shows how [TensorflowJS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) use model converters to run pre-existing TensorFlow models right in the browser.

The project demonstrates both the use of existing models (Mobilenet, etc.) and models trained for this project (Disney Characters Classifier, etc).

The backend function is performed by https://github.com/DanielGolikov/ml-showcase-backend
